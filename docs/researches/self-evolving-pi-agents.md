# Building a Self-Evolving System for a Distributed 24/7 Pi Coding-Agent Fleet

_Research synthesis + concrete AWS implementation plan · v2 · July 2026_

> **v2 changes:** rebuilt around a multi-device fleet on AWS (ECS / S3 / RDS Postgres / Lambda), an external RAG service, and Git-based distribution of skills and `.md` files. Adds the fleet-memory governance model, the two-channel distribution design, and a cloud rollout plan. The research synthesis, Pi harness map, and failure-mode analysis from v1 are retained and extended.

## 0. Verdict on your mental model

> "An evolution function will be triggered automatically at midnight for digesting today's experiences, and store it somewhere or change something to let the agents know."

Directionally right, under-specified in four ways. The fourth only appears once the system spans devices.

### ✅ What you got right

A periodic batch consolidation pass is real and necessary. ACE calls it the _Curator_, Hermes calls it _consolidation_, MUSE calls it _skill management_, AWS AgentCore calls it _extraction + consolidation_. You need it.

### ❌ Correction 1 — Midnight is too late to _capture_

By midnight the evidence is gone. Pi auto-compacts when context exceeds `contextWindow − reserveTokens` (default reserve 16384) and truncates tool results to 2000 chars during summarization. A bug fought at 14:00 is a summary-of-a-summary by midnight. **Capture must be event-driven** (`tool_result` error, `session_before_compact`, `agent_settled`, `session_shutdown`); consolidation can be nightly.

Also: 24/7 agents have no day boundary. Harvest by **file watermark**, not by session completion, or you will systematically miss the long-running sessions — which hold the expensive lessons.

### ❌ Correction 2 — "Store it somewhere" is the whole problem

Writing is easy and nearly worthless alone. The hard parts are **retrieval at the point of need** and **management** (update, compress, forget). The agent-memory survey literature names five operations — store, retrieve, update, compress, forget — and observes that most teams build the first two. Append-only stores end up with old and new versions of a fact coexisting, and the agent guesses.

### ❌ Correction 3 — "Change something" hides a fork in the road

| Tier           | Artifact                               | Cost                                          | When                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **T1 Rules**   | `AGENTS.md` / `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`       | Every token, every turn, every agent, forever | Universal short invariants only. Budget ~40 lines. |
| **T2 Skills**  | `SKILL.md` packages                    | ~1 line in prompt; body on demand             | Multi-step procedures worth re-running             |
| **T3 Lessons** | Queryable store                        | Zero until retrieved                          | Everything else                                    |
| **T4 Code**    | Lint rule, test, hook, script, CI gate | Zero context; enforced mechanically           | **The best tier**                                  |

**T4 is the most underused and most valuable.** A lesson is a request that the model please remember something. A CI check is a guarantee. Route every candidate through "can this become code?" first.

### ❌ Correction 4 — Once it spans devices, this stops being a memory problem

This is the change from v1. A shared knowledge store written and read concurrently by many autonomous agents on many machines is a **distributed systems problem in retrieval clothing**. The 2026 fleet-memory literature is unambiguous: retrieval relevance is table stakes; what breaks in production is scope, staleness, contradiction, and provenance.

Concretely, three things become mandatory that were optional at single-device scale:

1. **Single-writer discipline.** Many agents _propose_; exactly one process _commits_. Multi-writer memory with LLM-mediated merges is how you get contradiction persistence and unreproducible behavior. Your agents append to an immutable event log; only the nightly curator (and a narrow feedback path) mutates the knowledge store.
2. **Scope as a hard predicate, not a ranking feature.** The MemClaw/ArgusFleet study measured a **43.9% cross-scope leak rate on the search path** specifically because the scope filter "coexists with embedding-similarity ranking" instead of gating it. Your frontend agent's lessons must be _unreachable_ from a backend session, not merely down-ranked.
3. **Provenance and supersession as first-class columns.** Every lesson must answer: which agent wrote it, from which session, at which commit, superseding what. Without it, debugging a 3am regression is guesswork — and you cannot safely auto-rollback.

### The corrected shape

```
Loop 0  RECALL      per-turn, ms       retrieve scoped, temporally-resolved lessons before acting
Loop 1  REFLECT     per-session        capture failure→fix pairs while evidence is live; spool locally
Loop 2  CURATE      nightly, cloud     dedupe, resolve contradictions, promote, prune, evaluate, publish
Loop 3  DISTRIBUTE  continuous + git   hot path = API; cold path = signed git tags of skills/rules
Loop 4  OPTIMIZE    weekly             GEPA/DSPy over replayed evals, PR-gated
```

Your midnight job is Loop 2. Loop 0 and Loop 3 are where the value actually lands.

## 1. Research synthesis

### 1.1 The canonical loop — ACE (Stanford / SambaNova / UC Berkeley, arXiv 2510.04618)

Contexts as **evolving playbooks**, maintained by three separated roles:

- **Generator** — runs tasks, produces trajectories exposing helpful and harmful moves
- **Reflector** — critiques traces, extracts concrete lessons (the separation from curation is load-bearing)
- **Curator** — converts lessons into typed **delta items** with helpful/harmful counters, merged **deterministically by non-LLM logic**

Two mechanisms: **incremental delta updates** (localized edits, never monolithic rewrites) and **grow-and-refine** (append new, update in place, periodically dedupe by embedding).

Two named failure modes: **brevity bias** (compressing away the detail that made the lesson useful) and **context collapse** (iterative full rewrites eroding accumulated knowledge).

Reported: +10.6% on AppWorld agent tasks, +8.6% on finance reasoning, ~86.9% latency reduction vs. context-adaptation baselines — and crucially, adapting **without labeled supervision**, using natural execution feedback. Your CI exit codes, test results, and error strings _are_ the supervision signal.

> **Rule 1:** An LLM never rewrites the playbook. It proposes typed deltas; deterministic code merges them.

### 1.2 Skills as the unit of transfer — MUSE-Autoskill (ByteDance, arXiv 2605.27366)

Five-stage skill lifecycle: **creation → memory → management → evaluation → refinement.**

| Finding                                                                    | Number                                                    | Implication                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skills distilled from own successful trajectories beat human-authored ones | 87.94% vs 68.40% human ceiling                            | Your logs beat generic best-practice docs                                  |
| Generated skills are **Pareto-optimal**                                    | −20% tokens, −37% latency, 19→15 turns                    | Good skills _replace_ exploratory reasoning                                |

| Cross-agent transfer works unmodified                                      | Hermes +10.51 pp using MUSE skills                        | **Skills are portable assets — this is what makes fleet-wide sharing pay** |
| Generated skills 2.2× longer (326 vs 146 median lines)                     | —                                                         | Extra length is procedural: schemas, failure modes, steps                  |
| Catalog routing keeps cost flat                                            | 100 skills ≈ 5–10K tokens catalog vs ~500K for all bodies | Progressive disclosure is mandatory — exactly what Pi does                 |

**The warning:** a skill distilled from a _single_ trajectory encodes source-specific assumptions. MUSE's `hvac-control` regressed **80% → 20%** because a calibration routine that worked once was less robust than baseline trial-and-error.

> **Rule 2:** Never promote from one trajectory. Require ≥2–3 independent occurrences **from ≥2 distinct agents or repos**, and run a de-specialization pass stripping fixed paths, IDs, and magic numbers. At fleet scale you can afford this bar; at single-device scale you couldn't.

MUSE gates skill registration on bundled unit tests. 9% of its skills ship `tests/`; 0% of human-authored ones do.

### 1.3 CODESKILL (arXiv 2605.25430)

Skill-bank maintenance as a learned `add / merge / drop` policy. **+9.69 pass rate over no-skill baseline, +4.01 over the strongest prompt/memory baseline** on EnvBench + SWE-Bench Verified + Terminal-Bench 2, while holding the bank at **stable size**. Reasoning steps dropped.

> **Rule 3:** Bank growth is a bug, not progress. Enforce a hard cap and let the pruner do its job.

### 1.4 Hermes Agent + hermes-agent-self-evolution (Nous Research)

**Hermes** — self-evolving skills via a `skill_manage` tool, contained short-lived sub-agents, 24/7 operation, agentskills.io-compatible.

**hermes-agent-self-evolution** — DSPy + GEPA (Genetic-Pareto Prompt Evolution):

```

```

No GPU, ~$2–10 per run, all via API. GEPA reads execution traces to understand _why_ things failed. `--eval-source sessiondb` mines real session history.

**Copy the five guardrails verbatim:** (1) full test suite 100%, (2) size limits — skills ≤15KB, tool descriptions ≤500 chars, (3) **caching compatibility — no mid-conversation changes**, (4) semantic preservation, (5) **PR review, never direct commit**.

Cross-check: MUSE benchmarked Hermes at 47.89% no-skills / 61.21% with human skills on SkillsBench — leanest agent (median 163–172K tokens/task) but not the most accurate. Hermes' self-evolution is real, not magic.

### 1.5 Memory taxonomy — prevents the most common mistake

| Type           | Content                    | Correct retrieval                         | Common mistake                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Working**    | Current context window     | None — it's a _budget_ problem            | Treating it as retrieval                     |
| **Episodic**   | What happened & when       | **Recency first-class** + outcome quality | Pure semantic similarity                     |
| **Semantic**   | Facts about codebase, APIs | Content similarity (classic RAG)          | Mixing episodic logs into it, degrading both |
| **Sensory**    | Raw images/docs            | Summarize on ingest                       | —                                            |
| **Procedural** | Skills, playbooks          | Catalog + progressive disclosure          | Stuffing procedures into always-on prompt    |

**This directly determines where your RAG service fits.** Your RAG service is a _semantic_ engine. Point it at documents (ADRs, runbooks, API docs, session summaries). Do **not** make it the home of the lesson store, which needs exact scope predicates, transactional counters, and temporal supersession. See §5.

Multi-signal retrieval scoring (Generative Agents, still the best default):

```
score = w_r · recency_decay(t) + w_s · similarity + w_i · importance
```

MIA (arXiv 2604.04503) adds **quality reward** (did the past trajectory succeed?) and **frequency reward**, and retrieves **both successes and failures** for contrastive context. A 7B model with this beat a 32B baseline by 18%. Notably: _enlarging the context window made things worse_; compressed actionable workflow summaries beat raw retention.

### 1.6 Failure modes at single-agent scale

**a) Self-reinforcing error / false precedent.** Databricks documented agents retrieving notebooks from earlier _incorrect_ runs and reusing them **with more confidence**, because memory gave the wrong answer the appearance of established precedent.

**b) Over-generalization.** A lesson learned in a narrow context applied everywhere.

**c) Memory poisoning.** The MCFA study (arXiv 2603.15125): **>90% of tested agents vulnerable** via a _single normal-seeming interaction_, **100% relapse rate** when fixed conversationally. Models treat retrieved memory as established user preference and follow it over system rules. Only fix is at the data layer.

**d) Context rot / prompt-cache destruction.** In Pi, activating a tool with `promptSnippet`/`promptGuidelines` **rebuilds the system prompt**, invalidating the provider's cached prefix. ~50–60% of a coding agent's input tokens are cached prefix.

**e) The flat-line problem.** Practitioners widely report that agents accumulating notes in `CLAUDE.md` don't measurably improve at a codebase. Accumulation ≠ improvement. **Run the same class of task 5–10 times across separate sessions and plot the curve.**

### 1.7 Failure modes that only appear at fleet scale — _new in v2_

This is the research that changes the design. Source: _Governed Shared Memory for Multi-Agent LLM Systems_ (arXiv 2606.24535), plus the ASPLOS 2026 position framing multi-agent memory as a cache-coherence problem, and the _Always-On Agents_ survey (arXiv 2606.30306).

The paper formalizes a **fleet-memory system** as `F = (A, M, G, P, T)`:

| Symbol | Component                        | Your instantiation                                 |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**  | Set of interacting agents        | frontend-01…N, backend-01…N, infra-01…N            |
| **M**  | Shared memory substrate          | RDS Postgres + S3 + your RAG service               |
| **G**  | Governance / policy layer        | Retrieval gateway (Lambda) enforcing scope + trust |
| **P**  | Provenance metadata              | writer agent, session, commit, derivation chain    |
| **T**  | Temporal ordering / supersession | `supersedes_id`, `status`, `valid_from`            |

A write is `w = (agent, content, scope, time, provenance)` — **not an immutable conversational artifact but a state transition** that may supersede, invalidate, restrict, or contradict prior memory. Retrieval is `r = f(query, requesting_agent, governance_constraints, temporal_conditions)`, not `f(query)`.

**Four fleet failure modes:**

| Failure                       | What happens                                              | Your version of it                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unauthorized leakage**      | Agent retrieves memory outside its scope                  | A frontend lesson about CSS-in-JS surfaces in a Terraform session and the agent acts on it                     |
| **Stale propagation**         | Updates fail to synchronize; agents act on outdated state | `backend-02` learns the deploy command changed; `backend-01` keeps using the old one for 18 hours              |
| **Contradiction persistence** | Conflicting memories coexist unresolved                   | Two lessons say opposite things about the same build flag; both are retrievable; the agent picks one at random |
| **Provenance collapse**       | Retrieved memory can't be traced to origin                | A bad lesson tanks your eval and you can't determine which session produced it                                 |

**Empirical findings you must design around:**

1. **Scope filters that "coexist with ranking" leak.** Measured search leak rate: **43.9% (72/164)** of cross-scope probes still surfaced the row, because the fleet filter was applied alongside embedding-similarity ranking rather than gating it. Meanwhile GET-by-id enforced only the tenant predicate and **discarded a correctly-resolved agent identity** — a textbook confused-deputy bug. _Enforce scope as a hard `WHERE` clause on every read path, including direct lookups by ID._

2. **Deduplication starves contradiction detection.** This is the single most useful non-obvious finding for your curator. A synchronous near-duplicate gate rejected **206/400** writes before the asynchronous contradiction detector ever saw them. The pathology is intrinsic: _"a contradiction phrased naturally ('X is A' then 'X is B') is near-identical text, so the very writes the detector exists to resolve are the ones most likely to be rejected at the gate."_ Conditional on both writes being admitted, supersession was correct **90/90**. **Fix: run structural contradiction detection first when a write carries a structured assertion, or widen the near-duplicate threshold for such writes.** My v1 curator had exactly this bug; §7.3 inverts the order.

3. **Provenance is cheap and works.** All 50 depth-4 derivation chains reconstructed completely, sub-second per hop (p50 291 ms). There is no excuse for skipping it.

4. **The consistency cost is paid at write time or read time — pick deliberately.** Under synchronous ("strong") enrichment, write-to-visible was effectively one search round-trip (p50 0.83 s), but write latency p50 1.8 s with a p99 of 19 s under contention. Under async enrichment you pay a visibility tail instead. For your fleet: **writes are batched and off the hot path, so pay it at write time.**

5. **Rate limits break derivation chains.** Sequential writes within a chain abort if any intermediate write is throttled. Pace your curator's writes below the ceiling.

**And the risk that shared memory adds:** the _Always-On Agents_ survey reports that **shared-memory architectures propagate jailbreaks and poison more readily than independent-memory ones**, and names **memory contagion** — evaluator bias in stored trajectories propagating cross-temporally to future agents sharing memory, _with no safe contamination threshold found even under oracle consolidation_. Going multi-device raises the blast radius of one bad lesson from one machine to the whole fleet. This is the price of the sharing benefit and must be paid for with governance (§10).

**The counterweight — sharing does work.** StreamBench's MAM-StreamICL showed shared memory across heterogeneous agents outperforms isolated memory precisely because different agents have complementary strengths, at cost similar to a single agent. Agent KB found stronger agents can induce memories that weaker agents later leverage. For you: your backend agents' knowledge of the deploy pipeline genuinely helps your frontend agents, and vice versa. The gain is real; so is the contagion risk.

### 1.8 Retrieval architecture — hybrid, and why

Your RAG service handles the semantic leg. The lesson store needs a lexical leg too, because **symptom lookup is a keyword problem**: an agent staring at `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` needs the lesson keyed on that exact string, and dense retrieval is systematically weak on rare literal tokens.

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion** is the standard answer (Cormack, Clarke & Buettcher, SIGIR 2009), and it is what Elasticsearch and OpenSearch use:

```
RRF_score(d) = Σ_lists  1 / (k + rank_list(d)),   k = 60
```

It operates on **ranks, not scores**, which sidesteps the BM25-vs-cosine scale incompatibility that makes naive weighted averaging fail in production. A doc at rank 1 contributes 1/61 ≈ 0.0164; at rank 100, 1/160 ≈ 0.00625.

**On RDS specifically** (verified against current AWS docs):

- `pgvector` **0.8.0** is available on RDS PostgreSQL 14.14+/15.x/16.x and Aurora PostgreSQL 16.8/15.12/14.17/13.20+. 0.8.0 matters because it adds **iterative index scans that prevent over-filtering** — essential when you filter hard on scope before ranking, which you will.
- `pg_trgm` and native `tsvector`/`ts_rank_cd` are available. **`pg_search`/ParadeDB, `pgvectorscale`, and `timescaledb` are not available on RDS or Aurora.** So: use `tsvector` for the lexical leg (good enough for symptom lookup, especially combined with `pg_trgm` for fuzzy error-signature matching), or delegate the lexical leg to your RAG service if it exposes BM25.
- `pg_cron` is available but library-backed: it needs a custom DB **cluster** parameter group on Aurora (instance-level on RDS), `shared_preload_libraries`, and a reboot.

**On S3 Vectors** (GA December 2025, now 14+ regions, up to 2B vectors/index, ~100 ms or sub-second, up to 90% cheaper): the right home for the **trace archive** semantic index — millions of trajectory chunks, queried infrequently, where storage cost dominates. It does **not** do hybrid search on its own. Don't put the lesson store there; the lesson store is small, hot, and needs transactional counters.

## 2. Pi harness capability map

Pi is unusually well suited to this — its stated design goal is that extensions can _"inject messages before each turn, filter the message history, implement RAG, or build long-term memory."_

### 2.1 Hooks mapped to loops

| Loop             | Pi hook                                                              | Use                                                                                                                                                  |

### 2.2 Session format — your raw data

JSONL at `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<path>--/<timestamp>_<uuid>.jsonl`, one object per line, forming a **tree** via `id`/`parentId`.

```jsonc
{"type":"session","version":3,"id":"uuid","timestamp":"...","cwd":"/path"}
{"type":"message","id":"a1b2c3d4","parentId":"...","message":{...}}
{"type":"compaction","summary":"...","tokensBefore":50000,"retainedTail":[...]}
{"type":"branch_summary","fromId":"...","summary":"..."}
{"type":"custom","customType":"my-ext","data":{...}}
{"type":"label","targetId":"...","label":"checkpoint-1"}
```

Message roles: `user`, `assistant` (with `usage`, `stopReason`, `model`, `provider`), `toolResult` (`toolName`, `isError`, `details`), `bashExecution` (`command`, `output`, `exitCode`), `custom`, `branchSummary`, `compactionSummary`.

**High-signal mining targets, in priority order:**

1. `toolResult` with `isError: true` **followed later by the same tool succeeding on the same target** → a failure→fix pair. Gold.
2. Non-zero `exitCode` on a test/build/lint command, then zero → verified fix.
3. `assistant.stopReason: "error" | "aborted"` → stuck states.
4. Repeated near-identical tool calls in one branch → an inescapable loop.
5. `branch_summary` entries → an abandoned approach; _why_ is a lesson.
6. User corrections ("no, use pnpm") → highest precision, zero inference.
7. Long gaps between turn timestamps → where wall-clock burns.

The tree structure is a gift: an abandoned branch plus the branch that succeeded is a **naturally paired positive/negative example** — exactly the contrastive input MIA showed beats success-only memory.

### 3.2 Why not AgentCore Memory / a managed memory service?

AWS Bedrock AgentCore Memory is genuinely capable now — built-in strategies (`SemanticMemoryStrategy`, `SummaryMemoryStrategy`, `UserPreferenceMemoryStrategy`), built-in overrides, **self-managed strategies** (you own extraction/consolidation; AgentCore handles storage + search, with SNS/S3 payload delivery and `BatchCreateMemoryRecords`), metadata with `STRICTLY_CONSISTENT` extraction so application-supplied values pass through unchanged, and streaming notifications to Kinesis on record create/modify.

**Why I'd still not make it the core for you:** its built-in strategies are shaped around _conversational_ memory (facts, summaries, user preferences), not failure→fix pairs and procedural skills. The self-managed strategy is the only variant that fits, and at that point you're writing the extraction and consolidation anyway — so it's a storage+search layer competing with a Postgres table you already know how to operate, minus the transactional counters and supersession links.

**Where it _is_ worth adding:** if you want managed streaming notifications (Kinesis on memory change) to drive live cache invalidation across devices without building it. Consider it a Phase-4 optimization, not a foundation.

### 3.3 Read path latency budget

Retrieval sits in front of every turn. Budget **80 ms p50 / 200 ms p99**, and make it non-blocking:

```
local SQLite mirror hit   →  ~2 ms      (covers ~80% of turns)
gateway call              →  ~60-90 ms  (Postgres 15ms + RAG 40ms in parallel, RRF 2ms)
timeout                   →  250 ms hard, then proceed with local mirror only
```

**The injection must never be able to stall or fail a turn.** Wrap the gateway call in a timeout and a circuit breaker; on failure, fall back to the local mirror; on mirror failure, inject nothing. An agent with no lessons is strictly better than an agent that hangs.

### 4.1 `lessons` — the authoritative table

```sql

);

CREATE INDEX ON lessons USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
  WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
CREATE INDEX ON lessons USING gin  (fts);
CREATE INDEX ON lessons USING gin  (trigger gin_trgm_ops);   -- near-dup + fuzzy symptom match
CREATE INDEX ON lessons (status, scope, scope_team, scope_repo);
CREATE INDEX ON lessons (error_sig) WHERE status = 'active';
-- one active assertion per (subject, predicate): the DB enforces contradiction resolution
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX one_active_assertion
  ON lessons (subject, predicate) WHERE status = 'active' AND subject IS NOT NULL;
```

The **`one_active_assertion` partial unique index** is the cheapest possible defense against contradiction persistence: the database physically cannot hold two active answers to "what is the correct test command for `packages/ui`." A conflicting insert fails, which forces the curator to resolve it explicitly rather than letting both rows coexist.

## 5. Retrieval: the five-stage governed pipeline

Per the fleet-memory architecture, retrieval is **not** `f(query)`. It is `f(query, requesting_agent, governance, time)` executed in five stages, in this order:

```
1. candidate generation   →  Postgres lexical (tsvector+trgm) ‖ Postgres vector ‖ your RAG API
2. policy filtering       →  hard SQL/code predicate on scope + trust  ← DO NOT SKIP OR REORDER
3. temporal resolution    →  status='active' only; drop superseded; apply valid_until
4. provenance enrichment  →  attach writer, verification tier, occurrence count
5. ranked delivery        →  RRF fusion, cap at 5 items / ~600 tokens
```

Stage 2 must be a **filter, not a feature**. The measured 43.9% cross-scope leak in the reference implementation happened precisely because scope was applied alongside similarity ranking rather than gating candidate generation.

### 5.1 The core query

```sql
WITH scoped AS (            -- STAGE 2 FIRST: everything downstream sees only legal rows
  SELECT * FROM lessons
  WHERE status = 'active'                                    -- STAGE 3
    AND (valid_until IS NULL OR valid_until > now())
    AND harmful_count < 3
    AND (
         scope = 'fleet'
      OR (scope = 'team'  AND scope_team = $team)
      OR (scope = 'agent' AND writer_agent = $agent_id)
    )
    AND (scope_repo IS NULL OR scope_repo = $repo)
    AND (scope_lang IS NULL OR scope_lang = ANY($langs))
),
lex AS (
  SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY ts_rank_cd(fts, q) DESC) AS rnk
  FROM scoped, websearch_to_tsquery('english', $query) q
  WHERE fts @@ q LIMIT 50
),
vec AS (
  SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY embedding <=> $qvec) AS rnk
  FROM scoped WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL LIMIT 50
),
sig AS (   -- exact error-signature match: the highest-precision leg, ranked first
  SELECT id, 1 AS rnk FROM scoped WHERE error_sig = $error_sig
)
SELECT l.*,
       COALESCE(1.0/(60+lex.rnk),0) * 1.0
     + COALESCE(1.0/(60+vec.rnk),0) * 1.0
     + COALESCE(1.0/(60+sig.rnk),0) * 2.0      -- exact-signature leg weighted 2×
     + 0.15 * exp(-EXTRACT(epoch FROM now()-l.last_seen_at)/3888000.0)  -- 45d half-life
     + 0.10 * ln(1+l.occurrences)
     + 0.10 * (ARRAY[0.3,0.7,1.0])[l.verified+1]
     + 0.05 * ((l.helpful_count-l.harmful_count)::real/(l.helpful_count+l.harmful_count+3))
       AS score
FROM scoped l
LEFT JOIN lex ON lex.id=l.id
LEFT JOIN vec ON vec.id=l.id
LEFT JOIN sig ON sig.id=l.id
WHERE lex.id IS NOT NULL OR vec.id IS NOT NULL OR sig.id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 5;
```

Set `SET LOCAL hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order;` before this query — pgvector 0.8's iterative scan is what keeps recall acceptable under the heavy `scoped` filter.

### 5.2 Where your RAG service fits

Run it **in parallel** with the Postgres query and fuse with RRF at the gateway. Its job is the semantic leg over _documents_, not the lesson store:

| Put in your RAG service                                           | Keep in Postgres                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Session summaries (compaction + branch summaries)                 | Lesson rows with counters and scope              |
| Skill bodies (so the agent can find the right skill semantically) | Skill registry, versions, test status            |
| ADRs, runbooks, API docs, changelogs                              | Anything needing `UPDATE` or a unique constraint |
| Post-mortems                                                      | Anything needing supersession links              |

**Critical:** the memory-taxonomy research warns explicitly against mixing episodic logs into a semantic index — it degrades retrieval for both. Index _summaries_ of sessions, not raw turn-by-turn logs. Raw traces belong in S3 + S3 Vectors, queried only by the curator and the eval harness.

**Also critical:** whatever scope filtering your RAG service supports, do not rely on it alone. Post-filter its results against the same `scoped` set. If it can't return metadata sufficient to post-filter, only index fleet-scoped content in it.

---

## 6. Distribution: two channels

This is the part that makes "shared across different devices" actually work, and where Git earns its place.

### 6.1 Hot channel — the retrieval gateway

**Consistency:** read-your-writes within ~1 second of a curator commit.
**Carries:** T3 lessons.
**Why:** no sync, no version skew, works for a laptop that just came online. A new device is useful immediately.
**Requires:** network. Hence the local mirror.

**Local mirror sync.** Each device keeps a read-only SQLite copy of the lessons it's entitled to:

```
GET /v1/lessons/delta?since=<cursor>&team=frontend
→ {cursor, upserts:[...], tombstones:[uuid...], full_resync: false}
```

Pull every 5 minutes and on `session_start`. Tombstones matter: a retired or superseded lesson must _disappear_ from every device, not just stop being returned by the API. This is the **stale propagation** failure mode; without tombstones you get agents acting on retracted knowledge for as long as their cache lives.

This is a Bayou-style weakly-connected replicated store: authoritative single writer, monotonic cursor, tombstones for deletes, full resync escape hatch. Don't reach for CRDTs — you don't have concurrent writers to reconcile, by design.

### 6.2 Cold channel — Git

**Consistency:** explicit, versioned, human-reviewable, atomically rolled back.
**Carries:** T1 rules, T2 skills, T4 code artifacts.
**Why:** these are _files the agent reads_, they change the agent's behavior globally, and they deserve review, diffs, blame, and `git revert`.

**Consume on each device** — this is where Pi's package system does the work for you:

```json
// ~/.pi/agent/settings.json  (baked into the ECS image / device provisioning)
{
	"defaultProjectTrust": "always",
	"packages": ["git:github.com/org/pi-knowledge@v2026.07.31"],
	"skills": ["~/.pi/knowledge/skills"]
}
```

```bash
# systemd timer / ECS sidecar, every 30 min
pi update --extensions      # reconciles pinned git refs
```

Pin to a **tag**, not `main`. Promote the tag deliberately (canary team first, fleet after 24h). That gives you a staged rollout for free, and `git revert` + retag is your rollback.

Long-lived interactive sessions pick up changes on `/reload` (which fires `resources_discover` with `reason: "reload"`). For headless ECS agents, new tasks pick it up at start; you don't need hot reload.

### 6.3 Why both channels

|                             | Hot (API)                            | Cold (Git)                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Latency to fleet            | ~1 s                                 | 30 min – 24 h (deliberate)               |
| Blast radius of a bad entry | 1 turn's context, capped at 5 items  | Every session on every device            |
| Review                      | Automated gates only                 | Automated gates **+ human PR for T1/T4** |
| Rollback                    | `UPDATE status='retired'`            | `git revert` + retag                     |
| Works offline               | Via local mirror                     | Yes, it's on disk                        |
| Right for                   | High-volume, low-stakes, situational | Low-volume, high-stakes, behavioral      |

Route by stakes. A note that "vitest needs `--pool=forks` in this monorepo" is hot-channel. A rule that changes how every agent writes commit messages is cold-channel with a human PR.

**Shipper sidecar** (systemd timer on laptops, sidecar container in ECS, every 5 min):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
SPOOL=~/.pi/evolve/spool
DAY=$(date -u +%F)
# 1. observations
for f in "$SPOOL"/[0-9]*.jsonl; do
  [ -e "$f" ] || continue
  gzip -c "$f" | aws s3 cp - \
    "s3://$BUCKET/observations/dt=$DAY/agent=$PI_AGENT_ID/$(basename "$f").gz" \
    --content-encoding gzip && rm -f "$f"
done
# 2. full session JSONL (incremental; s5cmd handles the diff cheaply)
s5cmd sync --size-only ~/.pi/agent/sessions/ \
  "s3://$BUCKET/raw/dt=$DAY/agent=$PI_AGENT_ID/"

**Single-writer enforcement** — take a Postgres advisory lock for the whole Curate→Promote→Prune span. If a second curator run overlaps (retry, manual trigger), it blocks rather than interleaves:

```sql
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('pi-evolve-curator'));
-- ... all mutations ...
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(hashtext('pi-evolve-curator'));
```

**The critical ordering fix.** The v1 curator deduped first, then checked contradictions. That is exactly the bug the fleet-memory study measured: a synchronous near-duplicate gate rejected 206/400 writes before the contradiction detector saw them, and _"a contradiction phrased naturally ('X is A' then 'X is B') is near-identical text, so the very writes the detector exists to resolve are the ones most likely to be rejected."_ Invert it:

```typescript
async function admit(db: PoolClient, c: Candidate, runId: string) {
	// ---- STEP 1: STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTION FIRST, before any similarity gate ----
	if (c.subject && c.predicate && SINGLE_VALUED.has(c.predicate)) {
		const { rows } = await db.query(
			`SELECT * FROM lessons
        WHERE subject=$1 AND predicate=$2 AND status='active' FOR UPDATE`,
			[c.subject, c.predicate],
		);
		const prior = rows[0];
		if (prior && prior.object_value !== c.object_value) {
			// A genuine contradiction. Newer execution evidence wins; the old row is
			// SUPERSEDED, never deleted -- provenance must survive.
			if (c.verified < prior.verified)
				return {
					action: "rejected",
					why: "weaker evidence than incumbent",
				};
			const id = await insert(db, {
				...c,
				supersedes_id: prior.id,
				curator_run_id: runId,
			});
			await db.query(
				`UPDATE lessons SET status='superseded', superseded_by=$1, valid_until=now()
                       WHERE id=$2`,
				[id, prior.id],
			);
			return { action: "superseded", superseded: prior.id };
		}
		if (prior) {
			// same assertion: reinforce
			await db.query(
				`UPDATE lessons SET occurrences=occurrences+1, last_seen_at=now(),
                        distinct_agents = (SELECT count(DISTINCT x) FROM jsonb_array_elements_text(
                          source_sessions || $2::jsonb) AS t(x)),
                        source_sessions = source_sessions || $2::jsonb
                      WHERE id=$1`,
				[prior.id, JSON.stringify(c.source_sessions)],
			);
			return { action: "reinforced", id: prior.id };
		}
	}

	// ---- STEP 2: only now, the near-duplicate gate (for unstructured lessons) ----
	const { rows: near } = await db.query(
		`SELECT id, similarity(trigger,$1) AS sim FROM lessons
      WHERE status='active' AND scope_repo IS NOT DISTINCT FROM $2
        AND similarity(trigger,$1) > 0.72
      ORDER BY sim DESC LIMIT 1`,
		[c.trigger, c.scope_repo],
	);
	if (near[0]) {
		await db.query(
			`UPDATE lessons SET occurrences=occurrences+1, last_seen_at=now(),
                      source_sessions = source_sessions || $2::jsonb WHERE id=$1`,
			[near[0].id, JSON.stringify(c.source_sessions)],

	}

	return {
		action: "added",

	};

```

**Promotion, in tier order:**

```typescript
// T4 FIRST -- mechanism beats memory
const codifiable = await q(`SELECT * FROM lessons
  WHERE status='active' AND promoted_to IS NULL
    AND occurrences >= 2 AND codify_type <> 'none'`);
for (const l of codifiable) await openCodifyPR(l); // PR, never a direct commit

// T2 -- skills. Fleet-scale lets us demand independent corroboration.
const skillable = await q(`SELECT * FROM lessons
  WHERE status='active' AND promoted_to IS NULL
    AND occurrences >= 3 AND distinct_agents >= 2 AND verified >= 1
    AND length(guidance) > 200`);
for (const l of skillable) {
	const skill = await despecialize(await draftSkill(l)); // strip paths/IDs/magic numbers
	if (!(await runSkillTests(skill))) continue; // MUSE: tests gate registration
	await writeSkillToGitWorkdir(skill);
}

// T1 -- rules. Regenerate wholesale, hard-capped. Requires human PR approval.
const rules = await q(`SELECT * FROM lessons
  WHERE status='active' AND scope='fleet' AND verified = 2 AND occurrences >= 8
  ORDER BY occurrences DESC LIMIT 40`);
await writeRulesPR(rules); // opens a PR against org/pi-knowledge; never auto-merged
```

**Pruning** — enforce the stable-bank invariant:

```sql
UPDATE lessons SET status='retired'
 WHERE status='active' AND occurrences=1 AND verified=0
   AND created_at < now() - interval '90 days'
   AND (last_used_at IS NULL OR last_used_at < now() - interval '90 days');

UPDATE lessons SET status='quarantined' WHERE harmful_count >= 3;

WITH excess AS (
  SELECT id FROM lessons WHERE status='active'
  ORDER BY (occurrences * (1 + helpful_count)) ASC
  LIMIT GREATEST(0, (SELECT count(*) FROM lessons WHERE status='active') - 1500))
UPDATE lessons SET status='retired' WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM excess);
```

Every status change becomes a **tombstone** in the next delta-sync, so devices drop it from their mirrors.

### 7.4 Reflection: keep it isolated

Run the Reflector in a fresh Pi process with **no extensions, no skills, no context files, no tools** — the anti-bamboozle pattern from `pi-goal-list-loop-audit`. This is the trust boundary: the Reflector reads attacker-reachable content (error messages, dependency output, GitHub issue text) and must not be able to act on it or read what the fleet has already written.

```bash
pi -p --mode json \
   --no-session --no-extensions --no-skills --no-context-files \
   --tools "" \
   --model anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5 --thinking low \
   --append-system-prompt "$REFLECTOR_PROMPT" \
   "$BATCH_JSON"
```

## 8. Rollout

| Week    | Deliverable                                                                                                                                                        | Gate to proceed                                                                                        |

**Do weeks 1–2 in this order and no other.** Retrieval before reflection; measurement before both. The documented failure mode of every self-evolving system is a beautiful, growing, unread knowledge base.

## 9. Evaluation

### 9.1 Eval cases

```json
{
	"id": "vitest-esm-resolution",
	"image": "<acct>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/fe-monorepo@sha256:...",
	"git_sha": "a1b2c3d",
	"prompt": "The unit tests in packages/ui are failing. Fix them.",
	"verifier": { "cmd": "pnpm -C packages/ui test", "expect_exit": 0 },
	"budget": { "max_turns": 25, "max_usd": 1.5 },
	"class": "frontend-test-repair"
}
```

Run each **N=5** (binary-reward tasks have wide variance at N=1 — MUSE ran 5 and still flagged wide CIs), across three conditions: `--no-extensions --no-skills` (floor), current store, candidate store. Fargate Spot, one task per case×run, results to `s3://…/evals/runs/<date>/`.

### 9.2 Metrics

**Primary:**

| Metric                         | Definition                                                                       | Direction                                                                                                                   |

### 9.3 The experiment that answers your question

Pick one recurring bug class. Build 10 _different_ task instances that all trip it. Run them in 10 separate sessions, **spread across ≥3 devices**, in order, with the system live. Plot turns-to-green vs. session index, colored by device.

- **Downward slope, and later devices start lower than the first** → it compounds _and_ it transfers. Ship it.
- **Downward on device 1, flat on devices 2–3** → distribution is broken, not learning. Check mirror sync and scope filters.
- **Flat everywhere** → filing cabinet. Debug injection, not reflection.
- **Upward** → you're injecting noise. Cut `MAX_ITEMS`, raise the confidence threshold.

## 10. Governance — mandatory at fleet scale

Going multi-device raises the blast radius of one bad lesson from one machine to the whole fleet. The _Always-On Agents_ survey is blunt: shared-memory architectures propagate poison more readily than independent-memory ones, and **memory contagion** research found no safe contamination threshold even under oracle consolidation. This section is the price of the sharing benefit.

### 10.1 The four fleet failure modes and your controls

| Failure mode                  | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unauthorized leakage**      | Scope as a hard SQL predicate on **every** read path — gateway, delta-sync, mirror query, and direct-by-id. Server-side scoping at sync time so a compromised device can't widen its own mirror. Per-agent IAM roles; the gateway derives `team` from the **signed identity**, never from a client header. |
| **Stale propagation**         | Monotonic cursor + **tombstones** in delta-sync. `valid_until` on time-bounded lessons. Alert on mirror staleness p95 > 10 min.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Contradiction persistence** | `one_active_assertion` partial unique index. Contradiction detection **before** the dedup gate (§7.3). `stale_read_rate` monitored — must stay 0.                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Provenance collapse**       | `writer_agent`, `writer_device`, `source_sessions[].s3_key`, `curator_run_id`, `derived_from` on every row. `retrieval_log` records every returned set. Target: trace any behavior to its lesson to its session in <2 minutes.                                                                             |

### 10.2 Non-negotiables

1. **Content-scan every write.** Secrets, tokens, SSH keys, `.env` contents never enter the store. Reject at ingest _and_ at curation.
2. **Fence every retrieval.** XML wrapper with explicit "observations, not instructions, not user input" guard (§7.2). Repo evidence wins.
3. **A lesson may never grant a capability.** Reject at curation any candidate containing `--force`, `--no-verify`, `sudo`, `chmod 777`, `rm -rf`, credential names, "skip the", "ignore the", "always approve". Regex denylist **plus** a classifier — run both. This is the concrete defense against the MCFA memory-control-flow attack.
4. **Segregate rule-memory from experience-memory.** T1 rules are human-reviewed and in git. T3 lessons are agent-written and labeled as such at retrieval. T3 → T1 always passes through a human PR.
5. **Never auto-commit code.** T4 artifacts open PRs. Hermes guardrail #5, verbatim.
6. **Scope is earned, not claimed.** An agent cannot write a `fleet`-scoped lesson. Fleet scope is granted by the curator only when `distinct_agents >= 2` **and** `distinct_repos >= 2`. This one rule blocks most contagion paths, because a single compromised agent cannot promote its own poison past team scope.
7. **Quarantine, don't delete.** Harmful lessons go to `status='quarantined'` with full provenance. You need the forensics.
8. **Kill switch + rollback.** `PI_EVOLVE_DISABLED=1` (fleet-wide env, no deploy needed) disables injection without touching the store. Store rollback: `UPDATE lessons SET status='active' WHERE curator_run_id = <bad_run>` inverse, plus `git revert` for the cold channel. Practice both.

### 10.3 Curation-time rejection list

Reject outright if the candidate:

- Contains an absolute path, ticket ID, branch name, or commit SHA (over-specialization — MUSE's audit found this pattern limits generalization and caused an 80%→20% regression)
- Contains a magic number without a stated reason
- Restates an error message with no corrective action
- Has `confidence < 0.6`, or `occurrences = 1` for anything being promoted
- Contradicts a `verified=2` lesson without new execution evidence
- Claims a scope broader than its evidence supports
- Trips the capability denylist

---

## 11. Build vs. buy

### Buy (week 1)

```bash
pi install npm:pi-hermes-memory          # per-device memory, FTS5 session search, secret scanning,
                                         # skill_manage, correction detection. Ported from Hermes agent.
pi install npm:@braintrust/pi-extension  # or @raindrop-ai/pi-agent — tracing
```

Configure for a fleet (`~/.pi/agent/hermes-memory-config.json`, baked into the image):

```json
{
	"memoryMode": "policy-only",
	"memoryPolicyStyle": "compact",
	"reviewTransport": "direct",
	"llmModelOverride": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5",
	"llmThinkingOverride": "off",
	"nudgeInterval": 12,
	"nudgeToolCalls": 20,
	"flushOnCompact": true,
	"flushOnShutdown": true,
	"memoryOverflowStrategy": "auto-consolidate",
	"correctionDetection": true
}
```

`policy-only` injects a short _policy_ rather than the whole memory file (keeps first-turn tokens low); `direct` uses an in-process `completeSimple()` side-channel instead of spawning `pi -p`, **preserving the prompt-cache prefix**.

Also steal the layout from **`pi-self-learning`** (Matteo Collina): `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `monthly/YYYY-MM.md`, `long-term-memory.md`, `core/CORE.md` ranked by frequency and recency, all git-backed. That is your midnight-digest idea, already built and battle-tested — use it as the per-device layer beneath the cloud tier.

### Build (weeks 2–7) — the delta

| Gap in existing packages                       | Why you need it                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cross-device sharing**                       | Everything on the shelf is per-instance. A lesson learned by `backend-02` must reach `backend-01` and the laptop. This is the whole point of the cloud tier. |
| **Governed scope + provenance + supersession** | No package implements the fleet-memory primitives. This is what keeps a fleet from poisoning itself.                                                         |
| **T4 code-artifact promotion**                 | Nothing turns a lesson into a lint rule or CI gate. Highest-value tier.                                                                                      |
| **Failure→fix pairing**                        | Packages store failures; none pairs a failure with the later success on the same target.                                                                     |
| **Eval gate + rollback**                       | No package measures whether its own memory helps. This is what makes nightly mutation safe.                                                                  |
| **Git publication of learned skills**          | No package publishes signed, reviewable, rollback-able knowledge tags.                                                                                       |

### Consider later

- **AgentCore Memory streaming notifications** (Kinesis on record change) to drive mirror invalidation without polling — Phase-4 optimization.
- **S3 Vectors → OpenSearch export** if trace-corpus search ever needs sub-100ms hybrid; otherwise S3 Vectors alone is fine.
- **GEPA/DSPy** once the eval suite is trustworthy. It optimizes against your metric, so a bad metric yields confidently-wrong prompts.

**The eval suite is the dominant cost and the highest-value line item.** If it's too expensive: run the full suite weekly and a 6-case smoke suite nightly. Do not cut it entirely — an ungated nightly mutation loop over a shared fleet store is the one configuration you genuinely should not run.

For scale: MUSE measured ~578K tokens per no-skill task vs ~493K with a good skill. At 500 sessions/day, a 15% token reduction across the fleet is worth far more than $680/mo.

## 13. Two things I'd say if we only had five minutes

1. **Retrieval before reflection; measurement before both.** The failure mode of every self-evolving system in the literature is a beautiful, growing, unread knowledge base. Build the injection path and hand-write 20 lessons in week 2, before writing a line of the nightly job. If hand-written lessons don't move your metrics, generated ones won't either.

2. **Prefer mechanism over memory.** Every candidate lesson gets one question first: can this be a test, a lint rule, a hook, a script, or a CI check? A lesson is a request that the model please remember. A CI check is a guarantee. Your agents will keep making the same mistake until the mistake becomes impossible — and "impossible" is a code change, not a memory entry.

And one for the multi-device part specifically: **the only metric that justifies the cloud tier is cross-device transfer rate.** Instrument it in week 3. If lessons written by `backend-02` never fire on `backend-01`, you have built distributed infrastructure for a single-machine problem, and you should stop and fix the scope filters before building anything else.

## Appendix A — Reflector prompt

```
You are the Reflector in a self-improving coding-agent fleet. You convert raw
execution evidence into durable, reusable lessons. You are NOT solving the task.
You are NOT summarizing.

## Input
JSON array of observations from many autonomous coding agents on many machines:
  tool_failure         - a tool returned an error or non-zero exit
  failure_fixed        - the same tool later succeeded on the same target (STRONGEST SIGNAL)
  correction           - a human corrected the agent mid-task (HIGHEST PRECISION)
  pre_compaction_trace - a trajectory about to be discarded
  task_settled         - a task reached a terminal state
Each observation carries: agent, team, repo, git_sha, session id.

## What qualifies
[reusable]   A DIFFERENT agent, on a DIFFERENT task, next month, would benefit.
[actionable] It names a concrete corrective action.
[keyed]      Its trigger is an observable symptom, not an internal state.
[general]    It survives de-specialization.

## De-specialization (mandatory)
Remove: absolute paths, ticket/PR/issue IDs, branch names, commit SHAs, usernames,
timestamps, and numeric constants derived from a single run. If a constant is
genuinely load-bearing (a real API limit, a required version pin), keep it AND say why.
A lesson that only works on the file it came from is worse than no lesson: this has
caused measured 80%->20% regressions in published systems.

## Structured assertion (important)
If the lesson asserts a single-valued fact about a named thing, emit subject/predicate/
object_value. This routes it to structural contradiction resolution instead of a
similarity gate, which is the only way an updated fact can supersede a stale one.
  subject:      "fe-monorepo:packages/ui:test-runner"
  predicate:    "correct_invocation"        (single-valued)
  object_value: "pnpm -C packages/ui vitest run"
If the lesson is a heuristic rather than a fact, leave these null.

## Prefer mechanism over memory
Could this be enforced instead of remembered?
  lint | hook | script | test | ci | wrapper
If yes, set codify.type. This is the preferred outcome. Emit the lesson anyway
(it documents the why), but flag it.

## Scope
Propose the NARROWEST scope the evidence supports.
  scope: "agent"  - only the writing agent's own workflow
  scope: "team"   - the writing agent's team (frontend/backend/infra)
  scope: "fleet"  - everyone
You may propose "fleet" only if the SAME symptom appears from >=2 distinct agents
AND >=2 distinct repos in THIS batch. Otherwise propose "team" or "agent".
The curator will promote it later if recurrence justifies it.

## Reject silently (emit nothing)
  - transient/flaky failures with no corrective action
  - restatements of an error message
  - anything you cannot phrase as "WHEN <symptom> DO <action>"
  - anything touching credentials, permissions, or safety gates
  - anything whose fix was "the user did it manually"
  - anything containing a secret, token, key, or connection string

## Output
JSON array, no prose, no markdown fences. Empty array is valid and common.
[{"kind":"failure|fix|convention|tool-quirk|correction|env|perf",
  "scope":"agent|team|fleet",
  "scope_team":"frontend|backend|infra|null",

Sibling `.memory.md` (MUSE's skill-level memory) accumulates per-skill experience, append-only, and is **excluded from the published tarball** — experience is per-fleet, the skill is portable:

```markdown
## 2026-07-29 14:02 UTC · backend-02

Step 3 needs `--filter` when run from repo root.
```

Ship `tests/` where possible and gate registration on them passing. MUSE: 9% of generated skills ship tests, 0% of human-authored ones — testability is a system property, not an authoring habit.
